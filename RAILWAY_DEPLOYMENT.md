## Step 3: Update CORS Settings

After deployment, update your backend CORS settings:

1. Go to your Railway project
2. Navigate to Variables
3. Update `FRONTEND_URL` to your actual Railway domain
4. Redeploy the application

## Step 4: Test Your Deployment

1. **Test Authentication**

   - Try to sign up/login

2. Click "Custom Domains"
3. Add your domain
4. Update DNS settings as instructed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Fails**

   - Check build logs in Railway
   - Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility

2. **Environment Variables**

   - Double-check all variables are set
   - Ensure no typos in variable names
   - Verify MongoDB connection string

3. **CORS Errors**

   - Update `FRONTEND_URL` to correct domain
